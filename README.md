With the purchase of the https://vmdashboard.org domain, OpenVM is renamed to VM Dashboard. It is still the same great open source project, just a new name.

In addition to the name change, VM Dashboard now supports CentOS 7.
Setup instructions for Ubuntu and CentOS are available at https://vmdashboard.org/download

New to the software? Screenshots can be viewed at https://vmdashboard.org/screenshots
